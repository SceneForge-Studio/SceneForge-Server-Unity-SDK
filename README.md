System Requirements
-------------------

- Unity 2019.4

  https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/dotnetProfileSupport.html

From Unity 2021.2, KlakNDI is compatible with both the .NET Standard and .NET
Framework profiles.

Desktop platforms:

- Windows: x64, D3D11/D3D12
- macOS: x64 or arm64 (M1), Metal

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
- Dimensions of frame images should be multiples of 16x8. This limitation causes
  glitches on several mobile devices when using the Game View capture method.
  
  - When using NDI mode, it doesn't support audio streaming. There are several technical
difficulties to implement without perceptible noise or delay, so there is no
plan to implement it.
